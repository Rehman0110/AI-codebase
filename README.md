 This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly AI and Machine Learning programs written in Python using the Scikit-learn library. It covers a variety of core ML techniques including classification, regression, and anomaly detection using well-known datasets like:

🍷 Wine Dataset

🌸 Iris Dataset

🏠 California Housing Dataset

Each program demonstrates:

Data preprocessing (e.g., scaling)

Model training and evaluation

Visualization (confusion matrix, boxplots, heatmaps)

Interpretation of results
